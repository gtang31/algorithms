# Algorithms and Data structures
---
Implementation of some of the most basic data structures and the algorithms commonly used on them written in Python.
The intention of this repository is to help build and maintain my CS foundation.


Backtracking: used for finding ALL solutions to a problem. This is usually used to solve any permutation or combination problems

Dynamic Programming: used to solve optimization problems. Anything that asks for maximum, minimum, shortest, longest, etc can usually be solved with dynamic programming
