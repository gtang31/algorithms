# Algorithms and Data structures
---
Implementation of some of the most basic data structures and the algorithms commonly used on them written in Python.
The intention of this repository is to help build and maintain my CS foundation.



### Algorithms

1.) Array/Striing: anything involving iteration, two pointers inside a loop. Most commonly used in interviews.

2. Backtracking: used for finding __ALL__ solutions to a problem. This is usually used to solve any permutation or combination problems.

3. Dynamic Programming: used to solve __OPTIMIZATION__ problems. Anything that asks for maximum, minimum, shortest, longest, etc can usually be solved with dynamic programming.

4. Search: used for finding particular information in a specific data structure. This usually can be done by DFS (using a stack DS) or BFS (using a queue DS).

5. Greedy: used for finding the __closest__ best solution at the time. May or may not be most optimal, usually locally optimized but no globally optimized. Consider Dijkstra's algorithm as an example to greedy.

6. SQL: include some of the basic - advanced postgres sql queries.
    * __.db files__ are made with SQLite3 `.save` command
    * To open, use command: `.open /path/to/file/name.db`
    * Use `.read /path/to/schema/.sql` to initialize tables with default values


### Data Structures

1. Linked Lists: 
   * Singly linked lists
   * Stack
   * Queue

2. Trees:
   * Heaps
   * Binary
   * Binary Search
   * K-ary
   * Trie
