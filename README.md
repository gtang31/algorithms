# Algorithms and Data structures
---
Implementation of some of the most basic data structures and the algorithms commonly used on them written in Python.
The intention of this repository is to help build and maintain my CS foundation.



### Algorithms

* Backtracking: used for finding ALL solutions to a problem. This is usually used to solve any permutation or combination problems.

* Dynamic Programming: used to solve optimization problems. Anything that asks for maximum, minimum, shortest, longest, etc can usually be solved with dynamic programming.

* Search: used for finding particular information in a specific data structure. This usually can be done by DFS (using a stack DS) or BFS (using a queue DS).



### Data Structures

* LList: implementation of a singly linked lists and all the common procedures performed on this data structure. These procedures includes adding/removing from head/tail of list, deleting/inserting nodes, traversing the list, etc.

* Trees: implementation of a binary + K-ary trees and all the common procedures.
